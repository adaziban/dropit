I created this HTML based App as an alternative to Obsidian which is not open source anymore. 
There are still some issues regarding rendering the images.
I have decided not to use any toggle button to switch between edit and display mode. I wanted to keep both within a single window. 
The plan was to add file and folder encryption without IV or Encryption Data but I could not get working. 
Feel free to improve it. I am also open for any suggestions.  Peace Bros and sissss :-) 
**Usage:**
1. Paste the script to a text file and save it as xxxx.html
2. Open the xxxx.html and click on Choose Folder to Open a local folder as Root Vault.
3. Create folders or files from top right corner buttons. 
4. The files you create have .md extension. 
5. Write your documentation and keep all your data local.
